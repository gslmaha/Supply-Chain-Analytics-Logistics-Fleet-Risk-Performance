Supply Chain Analytics: Logistics, Fleet & Risk Performance

📌 Project Overview

This project delivers an enterprise-grade Supply Chain Analytics solution focused on logistics operations, fleet utilization, facility efficiency, and transportation risk management.Using Power BI and DAX, the dashboards provide executive visibility into profitability, operational bottlenecks, utilization, service levels, and safety risk.

🎯 Business Objectives

Track logistics revenue, margin, and cost-to-serve

Identify underperforming routes, customers, and facilities

Improve fleet utilization and delivery performance

Monitor safety incidents and operational risk exposure

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI

DAX (KPIs, Measures, Time Intelligence)

Star Schema Data Modeling

Interactive BI Visuals (Maps, Decomposition, Drill-through)

🧱 Data Model & Architecture

Designed a star-schema data model integrating:

Shipments & logistics data

Fleet & vehicle utilization

Maintenance & downtime records

Safety incidents & risk data

Optimized for scalable KPIs and time-intelligence analysis

Enabled cross-functional analysis across route, customer, facility, and driver
***

🔒 Data Availability & Privacy

Due to data size and confidentiality constraints, the complete dataset is not included in this repository.

A representative sample dataset is provided to demonstrate:

Data modeling approach

KPI logic and DAX calculations

Analytical structure and business reasoning

This follows enterprise data governance best practices.
